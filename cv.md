## About me as a person 
 
I am 27 years old and still looking for myself in the professional world. Right now I'm on my way in learning frontend.
I am a big fan of learning languages and finding logical connectivity in them. The greatest value in life for me is communication and building relationships between many different people.

## About me as an employee
I have excellent soft skills, but not only them.
I have design skills in figma and canva programs.
Experienced in copywriting for both advertising and website branding. 

By my first education I am a manager, I am able to lead projects and supervise the work of the team. 
By my second education (by GeekBrains university) I am a sm-creator.
And lately I worked in advertising, writing sales texts for the product.
